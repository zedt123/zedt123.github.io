<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a first year PhD student at Lancaster University, as part of the [ProbAI Hub](https://probai.uk), co-supervised by [Prof. Paul Fearnhead](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/paul-fearnhead) and [Prof. Chris Nemeth](https://chris-nemeth.github.io). My research interests include **diffusion models**, other **generative models** and **causality**. 

I hold a Master's degree in Computing from Imperial College London, where I completed a thesis on training Deep Sequential Latent Variable Models using Sampling Methods under the supervision of [Prof. Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Durham University.
